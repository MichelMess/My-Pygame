# Capstone-Project-2
## My Pygame 

## Game Information:
### Description
This Pygame project is a game program written in the Python language that was created to fulfill the level 1 task requirements for the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp that I am enrolled in.
The aim of this task was to develop skills to adapt to working with novel code libraries. 
Therefore, a simple Pygame program example was provided as a base to write our own game, according to the task level specifications.
This simple game includes one 'player' object, three 'enemy' objects and one 'prize' object.  

### Functionailty

When this program is run, a black game screen is displayed according to the size specifications in the code. The player object then appears at the top lefthand corner of the screen and the person playing
the game is able to move the player around using the up, down, left and right arrows on their keyboard. The three enemy objects then start moving across the screen from different positions. 
The person playing the game then needs to maneuver the player object so as to avoid collision with an enemy object; if they collide with an 'enemy', they lose and the game ends. 
If they are able to avoid the enemies and collide with the 'prize' object on the opposite side of the screen, they win the game and the game ends. If they avoid enemies but do not hit the prize, they also lose the game.
When the game ends, the appropriate 'You win!' or 'You lose' message is displayed. 

### How can I use it?
* Firstly, you need to clone this repository with the Task Manager program and related text files to a local repository on your computer, so that you can access and run the program.
If you need help, follow the instructions as set out github help webpage: 

  * https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

* In order to run this game program, you will then need to install the Python interpreter program, and Pygame onto your computer's operating system (OS). Please use the website addesses below for assistance:
  * https://www.python.org/downloads/   - Use this link to download the appropriate Python version for your OS (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux etc.).
  * https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted   - Use this link as a guide to using Python's Installer Program (PIP) to install Pygame.
  
 * Once you have finished installing Python and Pygame, you can view and run the code by accessing the IDLE program file that automatically downloads with the Python program files. 
 This is an Integrated Development Environment which allows you to read and execute the code. 
 
 * Double click on the IDLE program file to open it and a Python 'shell' window will appear. From here, you can click on the 'File' and 'Open' tabs on the top toolbar and navigate to the pygame program to open it.
 The program will then open in another window, separate to the Python shell.
 
 * **_NB:_** An important note before running the program! Make sure that the Pygame program and all the images (e.g. player, enemies, prize) are located in the same folder because the program will not be able to run or access the images if they are in separate folders.
 
 * When you are ready to run the game, click 'run' on the toolbar above where the game code is displayed. The game screen will then appear and you can start moving the player!
 
 * Have fun, beat the enemies and win the prize!
 
 ### Contributors
 The Hyperion Development company provided the base example code needed initially. This game code was then written individually for the task. However, it was reviewed and commented on by the helpful mentors at Hyperion Development!
